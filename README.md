This is the sample project for the [UIScrollView and Auto Layout](http://corsarus.com/uiscrollview-and-auto-layout) blog post.

This project demonstrates how to properly place subviews inside an UIScrollView using Auto Layout in order for the the system to automatically compute the contentSize and enable scrolling.


The code is written in Objective-C.
